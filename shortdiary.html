  <p style="line-height: 2.0; font-size:20px;" , color="white" > Hi, my name is Nurfarhana Elisa. People know me better as Hana, Elisa, Lisa, Sha, Elsa. In general, I am a shy person or in other words an introvert. However, some people think that I am arrogant. Actually not at all, I am a crazy person and very friendly towards people who have known me for a long time. I need time to get to know someone first before I can be myself.
    Hi, my name is Nurfarhana Elisa. People know me better as Hana, Elisa, Lisa, Sha, Elsa. In general, I am a shy person or in other words an introvert. However, some people think that I am arrogant. Actually not at all, I am a crazy person and very friendly towards people who have known me for a long time. I need time to get to know someone first before I can be myself. Next, I am a rather timid person. To be honest I'm a little afraid of the dark. There may be a reason of its own. When I was in primary school I was an assistant class leader, a bit empty because I wanted to be a school supervisor. However, in secondary school I had the opportunity to be a school supervisor from level 2 to level 5. Where I held the position of a councilor from level 2 to level 4, in level 5 I was promoted to secretary. Kinda surprised right? I became a council manager (mc) even though I am a rather shy person. But I admit I enjoy carrying out the responsibility. For me, it's a memory where I was able to do things that were quite impossible for me. At first it was a bit difficult for me but once I got used to it I enjoyed it. To put it simply, in college I was so quiet, so unsociable that people might think I was arrogant. To be honest, the university world is not like the school world. Much different than we thought. It's quite scary where we will get to know different types of people.</p>
