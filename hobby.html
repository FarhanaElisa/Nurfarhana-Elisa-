                            Hobbies are very important to a person, without having any hobby our life won't be as colorful as it should be. There are so many things that we can do as our hobby, such as collecting stamps, playing musical instrument, reading and doing sport activities. Most of the time, I always busy spending my time on my hobbies. When I'm in  a blue, I will also do my hobbies to cheer myself up. To me, hobbies is a way for us to show the people what kind of person are we, hobbies require devotion. Hobby won't be perfect without practices! I love every single things about my hobbies. If I'm alone, my hobbies would be there to accompany me. So, the following are some of my favorite hobbies.</p>
                            Drawing, drawing is my most favorite hobby of all. Some of people might already know about this, some might not. Drawing is my best friend. I started to draw since I was 5 years old. I love to draw because by drawing pictures is the only way to make things alive, even the things is unrealistic. I love to imagine all sort of things, such as my own house, heaven, hell and demons. I still remember when I was a young, I always drew all sort of pictures on the wall with my little crayons. My mum was always chasing me around so I won't hold any pencils or crayons. Till now, I still can't stop to draw. Drawing has become part of my life. During the SPM year, I stopped from drawing for a while and now I'm continuing to draw as much as I can. But, sometimes I'm too busy to draw because of my social life, studies and family. But still, I love to draw! My most favorite type of picture to draw is the the concept of horror and demons, I love to choose these concepts because, most of the people fear of them, but still, I'm weird sometimes.</font>
