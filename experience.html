            <p>
                memories where I myself never thought that thing would happen to me. Okay, in March last year, which is 2022, I planned with my family and one of my close friends to celebrate the birthdays of our other two friends, namely Yana and Erlynn, because their birthdays are in March, so I talked about celebrating near a place so that it would be easy to move. 
            <p>
                Then, my family suggested to welcome at the waterfall, I agreed and told my friend that we want to go bathe near the waterfall. Then, unexpectedly on a day that was important to me, I and some of my family members drowned and only Allah SWT knows that I really gave up because the four of us had lost air and that time I just thought "am I will die this way?" .
            <p>
                That was a very bitter memory that even now I am still traumatized about going to the waterfall. Thank God there are people who managed to save the four of us. Therefore, what I can conclude is that we can't have too much fun and be careful with what you say . Always be careful in what we do. - Elisa-
